# In this problem, your job is to identify the most popular hashtags appearing
# in a set of k posts.

# The input will describe the posts, with each post given by two lines (and
# with one blank line between each pair of consecutive posts):

# The first line will consist of a single integer between 0 and 1440
# (inclusive), the minute of the day at which the post was made. Multiple posts
# may have been made at the same time, and the posts will not necessarily be
# given in order of when they were made.

# The second line will consist of a non-empty string of characters (potentially
# including spaces), the content of the post.

# A token is defined as a substring of non-space characters in a post’s
# content, immediately surrounded on the left and right by either spaces or the
# beginning/end of the content. Please note that a token may include
# punctuation. A hashtag is then defined as a token beginning with a “#”. It’s
# guaranteed that no token will include an “#” anywhere after its first
# character.

# Output the single hashtag which appears the largest number of times across
# all posts. It’s guaranteed that at least one hashtag appears in the input,
# and that multiple hashtags will not be tied for the largest number of
# occurrences. Please note that post timestamps are irrelevant in this version
# of this problem.
